requires torch and torch_geometric

torch should be installed with conda - something like

 >> conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

important to make sure that (on a GPU node) torch.cuda.is_available() is True
otherwise something has gone wrong

torch_geomtric installation is more annoying. you need to get the subpackages from pip, and you need to make sure you're getting them from the right place. ie make sure the url below matches the torch version and cuda version of your main install

 >> pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.3.0+cu121.html
 >> pip install torch_geometric
